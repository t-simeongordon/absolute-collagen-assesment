# assesment
- recreated the wireframe into a custom shopify theme template 
- developed the product page based off the url provided
- imported Montserrat font using google fonts which is close to the desired Proxima Nova font

# bonus
- as liquid was a requirment for development manual testing/safe gurding techiques were used. In addition to test the website i used e2e testing using cypress
- to optimis performance i added lazy loading to my images within my carousel telling the browser to defer the loading of the image until the image is within the viewport or close to it
- error handling was used for liquid development to capture all edge cases
- applied my own custom styles using CSS


# testing
``` bash
    cd e2e
    npx cypress open 
```
